# Miner - a game based on minecraft
I'm going to try to have 
* very good graphics (thanks ue, sort of)
* cool world gen
* realistic mechanics (we removed fireflies being eaten by frogs because they are poisonous)
* AI
* maybe have good performance

#Problems
# Git has a limit on how many lfs files you can upload via git
  #solution: don't use git?
